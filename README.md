# Ninja-Frog-CODENITE
Platformer code implimentation.
Here the code for our big project CODENITE is based. The code in this project is in python which gives us the platformer implementation of animations. The real animations are not imported for now, rather we have used the sprites of TechWithTim: hence the name Ninja Frog.
We will later be importing this into UNITY.
